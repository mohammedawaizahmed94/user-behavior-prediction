# ðŸ›’ User Behavior Purchase Prediction using Random Forest

This project simulates a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a user will make a purchase (Revenue = 1) based on their browsing behavior. The dataset is synthetically generated and mimics typical e-commerce browsing data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This model performs the following steps:

1. Generates synthetic data for 1000 users.
2. Creates a binary target variable (Revenue) based on simulated purchase behavior.
3. Preprocesses the features using standard scaling.
4. Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
5. Trains a *Random Forest Classifier* to predict purchase likelihood.
6. Evaluates the model with accuracy and classification report.
7. Predicts purchase intent for a new user.
